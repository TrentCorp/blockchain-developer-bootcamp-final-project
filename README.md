# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
Consensys '21 Bootcamp Final Project

Time and work commitments leave me with a need to economise this project with a view to completing with limited availability.
The new project will involve the creation of a token type and assignment/trading/transfer/sale of these tokens.

*Token selection

*mapping for ownership and number of tokens owned by addresses

*Clean and secure transfer maths using SafeMath

*Multiple ownership with multiple sign off for transfer?
