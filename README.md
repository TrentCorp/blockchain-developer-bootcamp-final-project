Consensys '21 Bootcamp Final Project

A hospital care ledger for a patient undergoing surgery.
Due to the highly charged legal nature of the space as well as government data retention requirements a private blockchain solution may be suitable.

For this small project a patient at various points through their care journey reads and either rejects or confirms their procedure prior to undertaking it.

1. A procedure is prescribed by a physician and acknowledged by the patient
2. The procedure is scheduled by the hospital, complete with location, staffing & time
3. The patient accepts or rejects the terms and directions
4. The patient is admitted to pre-op and confirms their procedure, acknowledges legal concerns, etc.
5. Staff enters data pertaining to pre-op observations
6. The surgeon signs off that work has or has not been done


Essentially the blockchain should serve as a simplified consistent legal document of ackowledgement & consent.
